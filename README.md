## Introduction

The lms-server project is part of a Learning Management System, utilizing Node.js and Express to create a dynamic and efficient server-side application. It is structured to provide a seamless learning experience for users.

## Technologies Used

[Nodejs:](Nodejs) A powerful runtime for executing JavaScript code on the server side, providing the foundation for building scalable and high-performance applications.

[Express:](Express) A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs.

[DatabaseMongoDB:](Database) MongoDB: A MongoDB database system that offers flexibility and scalability, making it an ideal choice for storing and managing data in this project.

This combination of technologies ensures a scalable, maintainable, and feature-rich client application that can be seamlessly integrated with other components of the Learning Management System.

## Project Structure

The LMS-Server repository follows a well-organized structure to facilitate easy development, maintenance, and understanding of the codebase. Below is an overview of the project structure:

[config/:](config) Configuration files for the application, where settings and environment-specific variables are stored.

[controllers/:](controllers) Contains modules that handle the business logic of the application. These controllers are responsible for processing requests, interacting with the database, and returning appropriate responses.

[middleware/:](middleware) Custom middleware functions that can be applied to routes. Middleware functions handle tasks such as authentication, validation, and request processing before reaching the route handler.

[models/:](models) Defines data models and schemas used by the application. These models represent the structure of data stored in the MongoDB database.

[routes/:](routes) Express route handlers that define the endpoints and the corresponding controller methods for handling HTTP requests.

[utils/:](utils) Utility functions and helper modules used across the application for common tasks.

[app.js:](app.js) The entry point of the application, where the Express app is configured, middleware is applied, and routes are initialized.

[index.js:](index.js) The main file that kicks off the server. It typically imports and starts the Express app, connecting to the MongoDB database.

[package.json:](package.json) Metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and other configurations.

[README.md:](README.md) Documentation providing an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for setting up and running the application.

[LICENSE:](LICENSE) The license file specifying the terms under which the project is distributed.
